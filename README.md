# SLAE Assignments Source Code

This repository contains the source code and build scripts for the assignments in the SecurityTube Linux Assembly Expert (SLAE) course.

Student ID: SLAE-1294

## Building assignments

Required packages are python 2, nasm, build-essential on a 32-bit Linux system. The author used a 32-bit Kali Linux VM.

In general for `program.nasm`, `build.py` will emit files like these:

* `program.elf` - fully linked ELF32 binary containing this code
* `program.raw` - raw bytes of the .text section of the ELF binary
* `shell_test.c` - a C program that invokes the shellcode directly, simulating an EIP overwrite
* `shell_test` - compiled version of the test C program

## Assignment 1: TCP Bind Shell

Run the build script with the desired listening port.

    ./build.py 4444
